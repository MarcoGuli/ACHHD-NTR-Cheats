# ACHHD-NTR-Cheats
This is a plugin that contains a collection of cheats for Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer! These are heavily supported and added almost every day! Please help support any way you can!

**The cheats that are used in this plugin are:**

- Amiibo Spoofer
- ?? Eyes
- Text to shirt
- Text to item
- Walk over objects
- Special Keyboard
- All Emoticons
- Place object anywhere

**What each cheat does:**

 - **Amiibo Spoofer:** Press R while scanning a Amiibo. No longer requires an amiibo.
 - **?? Eyes:** You need to go change your eyes with the machine, accept changes and re enter the machine and you will see your character with two ?'s for eyes.
 - **Text to Shirt:** Type in the ID of the shirt that you want and press L to store it, and press R to change into the shirt.
 - **Text to Item:** Go into the search bar, type in the item ID (found in the Item ID List) press L to store it, press D Pad Up for a 'on table item' press D Pad Right for a 'regular item' and press D Pad Down for a 'carpet' item. Go inside and outside the room to see the change.
 - **Walk Over Objects:** Press R + D pad up to enable, press R + D pad down to disable. It's kind of buggy and sometimes your screen flashes black at times.
 - **Special Keyboard:** Open up your keyboard and press R to change some keys on the 'other' and 'special' tab to hidden change some keys to Nintendo symbols.
 - **All Emoticons:** Press L to get all emoticons. Note: Some emoticons are missing but they're replaced with hacked emoticons.
 - **Place Object Anywhere:** Press L to place an object anywhere you want. Some furniture might disappear after saving.

I'm requesting people to help with this plugin if they have anything interesting they'd like to share or change (ex: ram offsets, plugins, or improvements in my code)

**TODO:**
 - Alter the Readme to better reflect the current state of the plugin.
 
**How to compile:**
 - Download the latest version of [devkitPro](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/)
 - Run build.bat.
 - If everything works, then a new cheat.plg file should be created.
